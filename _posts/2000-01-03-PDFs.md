### Unpublished Works
### 2018	
* [Public Health Analysis: An Assessment of Polynomial Distributed Lag in Mosquito-Born Disease Risk Modeling](./pdf/CONRAD_Public_Health_Analysis.pdf)
	- The Public health analysis for the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine integrates and applies public health knowledge and competencies acquired during coursework for MSPH Biostatistics.
	- Using data for Ceara, Brazil, we construct a polynomial distributed lag model under different truncation lag criteria to predict reported dengue cases. Accurately predicting dengue cases provides the framework to develop forecasting models, which would provide public health professionals time to create targeted interventions for areas at high risk of dengue outbreaks.
### 2017
* [Honors Thesis: Mathematical Analysis for a Model to Control Chagas Disease: Fighting as Infection with an Infection](./pdf/Chagas_CONRAD_Final_Version.pdf)
	- Honors thesis for the Tulane University Department of Public Health and Department of Mathematics. This involved substantial independent research and study under the direction of professors in each of the respective departments.
	- We construct a two strain infection model for *Trypanosoma cruzi* and *Trypanosoma rangeli* host-vector dynamics to analyze the necessary initial conditions necessary for *T. rangeli* to outcompete *T. cruzi* in a given host-vector population. Introduction of *T. rangeli* into at risk populations can reduce the invasion rate of *T. cruzi*.
### 2016
* Modeling the Impact of Behavior Change on the Spread of Ebola. See Section "Published Works."
### 2014
* The Louisiana Institute of Public Health Tobacco Free Living Campaign
	-Needs assessment project of bar owners in New Orleans done with the support of the Louisian Public Health Institute (LPHI).
	-As a result of this research, in January 2015, the New Orleans City Council unanimously passed and Mayor Landrieu signed into law the Smoke-Free Ordinance. More information on this law can be found [here](https://nola.gov/smokefree/). More information on the Tobacco Free Living Campaign can be found [here](http://tobaccofreeliving.org).
