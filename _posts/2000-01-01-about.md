### About:
I am a mathematics, biostatistics, and public health professional who enjoys working on research teams to develop creative solutions, transforming how we analyze and view complex problems. 
I am fluent in LaTex, Matlab, SAS, and R coding. 
My passion is using deterministic and statistical modeling to interpret real world problems on a simpler theoretical basis.
