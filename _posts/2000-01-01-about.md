### About:

I am a Mathematics PhD student at Tulane University in New Orleans, studying under the direction of Dr. Lisa Fauci. My research interests include computational biofluid dynamics, modeling elastic bodies and fluid-elastic interactions, deformation of collapsible tubes, stokes flow, and female reproductive health. Originally hailing from rural northern California, I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Biology with a special emphasis on Education at Humboldt State University and Mills College. I am passionate about math education and have a background in teaching at math circles and working with public high school students in math and biology.
